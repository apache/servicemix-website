h2. Layout

In the bundles project, every version of every JAR we tranform into an OSGi bundle has its own directory.
There is a root pom.xml available to conveniently build SNAPSHOT versions of new bundles.

This project is a normal Maven build.  Just use *{{mvn clean install}}* to build.

h2. Jenkins

Jenkins CI build has been set up at [https://builds.apache.org/job/ServiceMix-Bundles/]
