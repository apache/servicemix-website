h1. Documentation Project

The ServiceMix documentation project aims to build a set of manuals for ServiceMix using [Scalate|http://scalate.fusesource.org].

It's currently used to generate the contents for:
- ServiceMix 4.4.x: [http://servicemix.apache.org/docs/4.4.x/]

--- name:building pipeline:conf

h2. Project layout
The project is a basic Maven WAR project.  Some important directories and files in the project:
* {{src/main/webapp}} : Contains the documentation page contents
* {{src/main/webapp/commands}} : TOC and index files for Console Commands manual section
* {{src/main/webapp/karaf}} : TOC and index files for Karaf manual section
* {{src/main/webapp/users-guide}} : The ServiceMix User's Guide section
* {{src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/scalate/layouts}} : Scalate SSP templates for the site

h2. Building and deploying

h3. Prerequisites
Before being able to build and run this project, you need to download and install:
* [Pygments|http://pygments.org/] : http://pygments.org/download/
* [Prince XML|http://princexml.com] : http://princexml.com/download/

h3. Static website and WAR
The documentation website and WAR can be built by running *{{mvn clean install}}* on the documentation project.  This will create and install:
- {{target/sitegen}}: a local copy of the static website
- A WAR file for installing the documentation on an application server
- If [Prince XML|http://princexml.com] has been installed, it will also create the PDF manuals

h3. Live website for editing
Running *{{mvn jetty:run}}* in the documentation project allows you to preview the resulting website on http://localhost:8080.  Just edit any page and hit refresh in the browser to have a look at the result.

h3. Deploying a new documentation site copy
If you're a committer, you can also deploy the site directly by running *{{mvn scm-publish:publish-scm}}* afterwards.  This will upload a new copy to {{https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/servicemix/site/production/}}.

h2. Hudson builds
A Hudson build has been set up for trunk in http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/ServiceMix-Docs/
