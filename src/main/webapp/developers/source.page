At the Apache ServiceMix project, we are maintaining a few versions of ServiceMix, each of which has its own set of modules, components, ...
The information on this page will show you where the source code lives for all these different bits and pieces, as well as provide you with instructions on how to build the projects.

h2. [ServiceMix|smx-source]

For ServiceMix 5 and higher, we have switched back to a single code repository that contains the entire project codebase.

* [ServiceMix|smx-source]: ServiceMix container based on Apache Karaf

h2. [ServiceMix Bundles|bundles-source]

The Bundles project contains OSGi-fied versions of popular Java JARs that we use for building ServiceMix.

* [ServiceMix Bundles|bundles-source]: a set of OSGi bundles for all kinds of dependency JARs

h2. [ServiceMix Specs|specs-source]

The servicemix-specs project contains OSGi-fied versions of popular JSR-* specifications.
It also contains helper classes to allow these specifications to lookup suitable implementations more efficiently in an OSGi environment.

* [ServiceMix Specs|specs-source]: a set of OSGi-fied and -enhanced versions for Java specifications like JAXB, JAX-RS, ...

h2. [ServiceMix 3.x|smx3-source]

The ServiceMix documentation project aims to build a set of manuals for ServiceMix using [Scalate|http://scalate.fusesource.org].

More information about the source code locations and how to build the documentation project, can be found [here|documentation-source].


h2. [Website|website-source]

We are also maintaining our website with Maven project, using [Scalate|http://scalate.fusesource.org/] to generate the pages from the source files.
