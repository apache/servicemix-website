# IRC

Although the preferred means of communication regarding ServiceMix is always the [mailing lists](/community/mailing-lists.html), you can also find most of us hanging out on the [#apache-servicemix channel](irc://irc.freenode.org/#apache-servicemix) on the Codehaus IRC server. Many of us hang out there while we're working because it's a good place to have quick chats.

## Connecting to IRC

Below is the connection information:

* **server**: `irc.freenode.org`
* **port**: `6667`
* **channel**: `#apache-servicemix`

Note the IRC channel on codehaus is deprecated as of April 2015; please refrain from using that room.

### Use the KiwiIRC Client

### Other IRC Clients

To connect to the Codehaus IRC server, you'll need an IRC client. There's a decent [list of IRC clients on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IRC_clients) along with some feature comparisons and other information.
