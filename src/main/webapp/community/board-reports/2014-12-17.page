Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Project Status
--------------
The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF and Apache Camel.

Activity on the mailing lists and in JIRA has been a bit slow, but we did
manage to stick to a steady release schedule and get a few new releases out.
Apart from the maintenance releases on the 5.0.x and 5.1.x branches, we also
released a new 5.3.0 version.

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Community
---------

the 5.0.x branch, but we do plan to keep our release schedule going with

We're also working towards further 5.x releases and a 6.0.0 release to
provide our users with major version upgrades of Karaf, Camel, CXF, ...
