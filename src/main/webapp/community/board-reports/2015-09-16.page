Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Project Status
--------------
The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF, Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ.

Activity on the mailing lists and in JIRA has been a bit slow over the
summer, but is picking up again now that we're planning to do new releases.

We have released the first release from the new 6.0.x, which is based on 
Karaf 3.0.x and includes numerous new features. We have also provided the 
users with a new release 5.5.0, based on Karaf 2.4.x and containing upgrades 
to the newest dependencies and some new features. We have also released the 
next maintenance releases 5.4.1 and 5.1.6 and 3 sets of OSGi bundles.

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Community
---------
Currently 49 committers and 22 PMC members in the project. No new PMC members nor 
committers were added in the last 3 months. Last committer addition was Wim Verreydt
on July 05 2014. Last PMC addition was Krzysztof Sobkowiak on July 05 2014. 

Community Objectives
--------------------
After the 6.0.0 release, our goal for the next period is to make the branch 6.0.x as 
a new stable line of ServiceMix. We're not expecting too much dependency updates to 
become available for the 5.1.x, 5.2.x and 5.3.x branches, but we do plan to keep our 
release schedule going with the 5.4.x and 5.5.x releases. We plan to keep a steady 
release schedule and keep up with new fix releases of our dependency projects. 

We also plan to start the work on the new ServiceMix 7.x line, which should be based 
on Karaf 4.x and will include numerous new features and dependency upgrades. 

Our goal for the next months is to improve the documentation and website.
