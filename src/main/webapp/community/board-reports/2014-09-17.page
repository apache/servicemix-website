Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Project Status
--------------
The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF and Apache Camel.

With all the version upgrades and the JIRA notifications that go with it,
we decided to create a separate issues@ list to make it easier for people
to notice and contribute to the actual discussions at the dev@ list.

Activity on the mailing lists and in JIRA has been a bit slow over the
summer, but is picking up again now that we're planning to do new releases.

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Community
---------
Since our last board report, we voted in 1 new committer, Wim Verreydt.
We also invited Krzystof Sobkowiak to join the PMC.

Community Objectives
--------------------
After the initial few 5.0.x and 5.1.x releases, the goal is to keep a
steady release schedule and keep up with new fix releases of our
dependency projects.

We're also working towards further 5.x releases and a 6.0.0 release to
provide our users with major version upgrades of Karaf, Camel, CXF, ...
