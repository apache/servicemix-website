Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.


Project Status
==============

The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF, Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ.

Activity on the mailing lists and in JIRA has been a bit slow over the year
change, but is picking up again now that we're planning to do new releases.
We had also some new contributions.

We have focused on providing users with latest and greatest technology and
worked on upgrade of Apache Karaf, ActiveMQ, Camel and CXF versions.

During the last period the last maintenance version 5.4.3 has been released.
We have decided to stop further development on the branch 5.4.x. We have also
released the stable releases 5.5.2, 5.5.3 and 6.0.2 and the new release 5.6.0
from the development branch. During this period 4 sets of OSGi bundles and new
Specs has been released too.

We have focused on the development of ServiceMix 7 and released the first preview
of 7.0.0 which is based on Karaf 4.0.0 and includes numerous new features. We are
working now towards a 7.0.0 release. We are fixing first issues reported by users
for the preview release. In the new period we are going to focus on the further
development and stability of ServiceMix 7 to be able to provide the community the
first stable release.

We do plan to keep our release schedule going with the 5.5.x, 5.6.x, 6.0.x and
6.1.x releases. We plan to keep a steady release schedule and keep up with new
fix releases of our dependency projects.

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.
