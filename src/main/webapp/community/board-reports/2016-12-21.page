{code}
Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Issues
======

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Activity
========

The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF, Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ.

During the las period we have provided the users with new maintenance release
6.0.5 and new updates 5.6.2 and 6.1.3 from the development branches. We have
decided to transit the 5.5.x branch into EOL, as there is no more development
on this branch nor on the proper versions of the related projects. We have also
released 2 new OSGi bundle sets.

We have also released the last preview release of ServiceMix 7 (7.0.0.M3). We
plan to release the final version at the end of this year.

In the next period we plan to focus on ServiceMix 7, but we also expect to provide
the maintenance releases for ServiceMix 5 and 6, as long new dependencies will be
available.


Health report
=============

Activity on the mailing lists and in JIRA is on the same level like in the last period.
We had some new contributions. We have lost a lot of our momentum now that major parts
of the functionality are being maintained in related projects like Apache Karaf and Apache
Camel.
