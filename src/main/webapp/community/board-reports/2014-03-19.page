Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Project Status
--------------
We have lost a lot of our momentum now that major parts of the functionality
are being maintained in related projects like Apache Karaf and Apache Camel.

In the past month, we've had a discussion on the users@ mailing list about
the status of the project and whether or not ServiceMix is offering any added
value over directly using the related projects. We did get quite a bit of
positive feedback and as a result, we now have more activity again in JIRA 
as well as on the mailing lists.

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Community
---------
Since our last board report, we added 3 new people to the PMC: Dan Kulp,
Jonathan Anstey and Willem Jiang. The last committer was added in November 2011.

Community Objectives
--------------------
The main goal at the moment is getting the Apache ServiceMix 5.0.0 release
out, in which we will drop support for a few features considered obsolete to
ensure it's easier to keep a steady release schedule in the future.

Releases
--------
- Apache ServiceMix Specs 2.4.0 in January
- A set of 22 OSGi bundles in January
- A set of 67 OSGi bundles in February
- A set of 59 OSGi bundles in March
