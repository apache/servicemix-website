Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Project Status
--------------

The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF, Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ.

Activity on the mailing lists and in JIRA has been a bit slow over the year
change, but is picking up again now that we're planning to do new releases.

We have focused on providing users with latest and greatest technology and 
worked on upgrade of Karaf, Camel and CXF versions. Apart from the first  
release on the 5.4.x branch, based on Karaf 2.4.x, we have released 2 transition
releases on 5.2.x and 5.3.x branches to help people choose the right upgrade path
from the current maintenance release.

We have also released the first preview of ServiceMix 6.0.0, which is based on 
Karaf 3.0.x and includes numerous new features.   

We have decided to decouple ServiceMix Bundles and ServiceMix Specs from 
ServiceMix 4 code and maintain them a separate subprojects. We have also migrated
the source code from svn to git repositories. 

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Community
---------

Since the last board report Krzysztof Sobkowiak has been approved by the board 
as a new PMC chair (February 18 2015). No new PMC members nor committers were 
added in the last 3 months. Last committer addition was Wim Verreydt on July 05 2014.
Last PMC addition was Krzysztof Sobkowiak on July 05 2014. 

Community Objectives
--------------------

After the 5.4.0 release, the goal is to make the branch 5.4.x as a new stable line 
of ServiceMix. We plan to keep a steady release schedule and keep up with new fix 
releases of our dependency projects.  

We're also working towards further 5.x releases and a 6.0.0 release to
provide our users with major version upgrades of Karaf, Camel, CXF. 

At the same time, we plan to do some work in order to update the documentation
and migrate it to Asciidoc.
