Description
===========

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Issues
======

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Activity
========

The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF, Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ.

- We have released 2 sets of OSGi bundles and the next set is on vote.
- We have migrated our repositories to gitbox.
- The work on ServiceMix Assembly and documentation was outstanding last
  months. I'd like to start discussion in the community about the next steps
  to provide a new assembly (probably new ServiceMix 8.x line), how can we
  focus more on cloud capabilities and how can we make the community more
  attractive for new people.

Health report

  slower than during the last period.
