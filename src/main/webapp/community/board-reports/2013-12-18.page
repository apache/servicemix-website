Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Project Status
--------------
We have lost a lot of our momentum now that major parts of the functionality
are being maintained in related projects like Apache Karaf and Apache Camel.

Most of the work being done at the moment, is aimed at doing maintenance
releases to keep up with the Apache Camel, CXF, Karaf, ... releases and doing
bundles releases of updated dependencies.

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.
