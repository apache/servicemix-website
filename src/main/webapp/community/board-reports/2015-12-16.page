Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Project Status
--------------
The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF, Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ.

Activity on the mailing lists and in JIRA is picking up. We had some new 
contributions. We also have been giving a talk about ServiceMix during 
an 33rd Degree 4charity conference in Wroclaw (Poland).

We have achieved the stability of he ServiceMix 6. The new fix version 6.0.1
has been released. We have also released a new version 6.1.0 containing 
upgrades to the newest dependencies and some new features.

During the last period the new maintenance version 5.4.2 and the new stable 
version 5.5.1 have been released. We have also decided to stop further 
development on the old branches 5.1.x, 5.2.x and 5.3.x. 

We have decided to decouple ServiceMix Plugins from ServiceMix 4 code and 
maintain them a separate subproject. The source code has been migrated
from svn to git repositoriy. A new fix version 1.3.1 of Maven Depend Plugin
has been released. We have also released 3 sets of OSGi bundles.

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Community Objectives
--------------------
We're not expecting too much dependency updates to become available for the 
5.4.x, but we do plan to keep our release schedule going with the 5.4.x, 
5.5.x and 5.6.x (the new development branch) releases. We plan to keep a 
steady release schedule and keep up with new fix releases of our dependency 
projects. 

In the new period we are going to focus on the further development, stability 
and maintenance of ServiceMix 6.

Our goal for the next period is to start the development of the new ServiceMix 
7.x line and release the first stable version from it.
