Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Project Status
--------------
The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF and Apache Camel.

After the discussion about the future of ServiceMix a few months ago, we
managed to get two new releases out. As a result, activity on the mailing
lists and in JIRA has increased a bit again over the past few months.

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Community
---------
Since our last board report, we voted in 1 new committer, Krzysztof Sobkowiak.
Last additions to the PMC were made in January 2014.

Community Objectives

After the initial few 5.0.x releases, the goal is to keep a steady release
schedule.  We're also working towards a 5.1.0 and 6.0.0 release to provide
our users with major version upgrades of Karaf, Camel, CXF, ...

At the same time, there's some work being done in order to update the website
and docs.
