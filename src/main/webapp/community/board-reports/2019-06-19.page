Description
===========

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Issues
======

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Activity
========

The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF, Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ.

- We have released 5 sets of OSGi bundles.
- The work on ServiceMix Assembly was outstanding for a longer time. There was
  a lot of stuff implemented in the main components of the Assembly (Apache
  Karaf, Apache Camel,...). I hope we manage to discuss the future versions of
  the Assembly (and the themes around it, like documentation and samples)
  during the next period.
