Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Project Status
--------------
While we continue to have decent community activity, we also have lost
a lot of our momentum now that major parts of the functionality are being
maintained in related projects like Apache Karaf and Apache Camel.

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Community
---------
No changes since last report.  The last addition to the PMC dates back
to September 2009.  The last committer was added in November 2011.

Community Objectives
--------------------
Since our last board report, we have finished the 4.5.2 release and we
are continuing to work on our 5.0.0 release.

Thanks to the excellent support of the folks at infra@, we now have a
setup in place that allows us to publish some of larger assembly
artifacts ourselves again.

Releases
--------
- Apache ServiceMix 4.5.2 in July
- A set of 14 OSGi bundles in July
- Another set of 35 OSGi bundles in September
