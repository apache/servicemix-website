## Description:
Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

## Issues:
There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:

## Project Activity:
- During the last period we have released 3 sets of OSGi bundles and Specs
  - Apache ServiceMix Specs (jaxb-api) on March 08 2020
  - Apache ServiceMix Bundles 2020.03 on April 03 2020
  - Apache ServiceMix Bundles 2020.04 on May 04 2020
  - Apache ServiceMix Bundles 2020.05 on June 08 2020
- During the next period we are going to provide
  - the next Bundles and Specs releases

## Community Health:
- During the last period the activity of the community (mailing lists, JIRA,
  releases) has been slower than during the last period.
- As stated in the previous report, due to low interest to provide further
  releases of ServiceMix Assembly we are preparing the project to move it to
  Attic:
  - We are going to provide the ServiceMix user a smooth path to migrate to
    Karaf ecosystem by writing an migration guide and a documentation about
    running integration in the vanilla Karaf.
  - We are going to move the Bundles and Specs to Apache Karaf or provide
    there another mechanism to consume Java libraries as OSGi bundles. Until we
    achieve this we are going to provide next releases for the required bundles
    and specs.
