## Project Activity:

- During the last period we have released 3 sets of OSGi bundles and Specs
  - Apache ServiceMix Specs (jaxb-api, jaxws-api, saaj-api) on January 08 2020
  - Apache ServiceMix Bundles 2019.12 on January 08 2020
  - Apache ServiceMix Bundles 2020.01 on February 03 2020
- During the next period we are going to provide
  - the next Bundles and Specs releases
  - the ServiceMix 8.x assembly with updates to the new releases of
the dependency projects

## Community Health:

Due to a low activity in the project and low interest to provide further
releases of ServiceMix Assembly we are currently discussing about the future
of the ServiceMix project. Our draft plan is to:
- move the Bundles and Specs to Apache Karaf or provide in Apache Karaf
a descriptor mechanism which lets us to avoid to provide a bundle for each
Java library
 - provide the ServiceMix 8 assembly which is built on the newest releases
of Apache Karaf, Apache Camel and other dependency projects
- provide a documentation explaining how to "migrate" from ServiceMix
to Karaf "ecosystem". The purpose is to provide smooth path to ServiceMix users.
- maybe provide an Integration distribution of Apache Karaf
- provide in Apache Camel or Apache Karaf project a documentation about running
integration in the Karaf "ecosystem"
- move the ServiceMix project to attic
