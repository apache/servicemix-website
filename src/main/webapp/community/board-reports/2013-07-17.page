Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Project Status
--------------
While we continue to have decent community activity, we also have lost
a lot of our momentum now that major parts of the functionality are being
maintained in related projects like Apache Karaf and Apache Camel.

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Community
---------
No changes since last report.  The last addition to the PMC dates back
to September 2009.  The last committer was added in November 2011.

Community Objectives
--------------------
Since our last board report, we have finished the 4.5.1 release and we
are continuing to work on both a 4.5.2 and 5.0.0 release at the moment.

It was raised on the dev@ list that we can no longer publish release
artifacts larger than 200 MB without intervention from infra@.  Since
some of our assemblies are larger than that, we pinged infra@ to figure
out how to get that addressed for doing these next 2 releases.

Branding Status
---------------
Since our last board report, we have found a volunteer to add the TM
to our logo. The new logo is now being used on the website.

Releases
--------
- Apache ServiceMix 4.5.1 in March
- A set of 35 OSGi bundles in April
- Another set of 20 OSGi bundles in April
- A set of 24 OSGi bundles in May
- A set of 23 OSGi bundle in July (vote in progress)
