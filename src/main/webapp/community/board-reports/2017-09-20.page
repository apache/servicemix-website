Description
===========

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Issues
======

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Activity
========

The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF, Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ.

- We don't expect any new releases in for dependencies of ServiceMix 6 and
we have transited it in EOL.
- We want currently focus on ServiceMix 7 and upgrading preparing the new
release containing the newest versions of Apache Karaf and Apache Camel.
- We have released 4 sets of OSGi bundles and a new release of ServiceMix Specs.
- We are going to make a small refactoring of ServiceMix features to give them a separate
lifecycle (as ServiceMix Features) and provide better modularity and maintainability of
ServiceMix.
- We are going to focus more on improvement of the documentation (which was migrated lately
into the Asciidoc format) and improvement of the examples to give people easier start into
integration with ServiceMix.
