Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Project Status
--------------
While we continue to have an active community with good participation from
users on mailing lists, IRC, and issue reporting in JIRA, we also have lost
some of our momentum now that major parts of the functionality are being
maintained in related projects like Apache Karaf and Apache Camel.

With the community objectives mentioned below, we want to ensure a new and
better focus for the Apache ServiceMix project.

Community
---------
No changes since last report.

Community Objectives
--------------------
One of the things we set out to do was to improve our release schedule in
order to gain some momentum again.  With the initial 4.4.0 release out in
December last year, we managed to get two fix releases out since then.
Our current objective is to work on a ServiceMix 4.5.0 release and then
start doing fix releases on that version as well to ensure we keep our
steady delivery schedule.

We keep on working on the documentation and website to ensure both new and
existing users are finding their way around the project more easily.  One
of the challenges there was the mix of ServiceMix 3.x and ServiceMix 4.x
related content.

Therefore, we recently had a discussion on the mailing list to put the focus
on ServiceMix 4.x entirely and starting to communicate to our user base that
we are no longer planning lots of new activity on the ServiceMix 3.x
branches.  We came up with a plan to do 2 more 3.4.x fix releases until the
end of 2012, but no new minor releases are being planned at the moment.
