Project Status
--------------
While we continue to have an active community with good participation from users on mailing lists, IRC, and issue reporting
in JIRA, we also have lost some of our momentum now that major parts of the functionality are being maintained in related
projects like Apache Karaf and Apache Camel.

With the community objectives mentioned below, we want to ensure a new and better focus for the Apache ServiceMix project.

Community
---------
No changes since last report.

Community Objectives
--------------------
One of the things we set out to do was to improve our release schedule in order to gain some momentum again.
With the initial 4.4.0 release out in December last year, we managed to get two fix releases out since then.
Our current objective is to work on a ServiceMix 4.5.0 release and then start doing fix releases on that version as well
to ensure we keep our steady delivery schedule.

We keep on working on the documentation and website to ensure both new and existing users are finding their way around
the project more easily.  One of the challenges there was the mix of ServiceMix 3.x and ServiceMix 4.x related content.

Therefore, we recently had a discussion on the mailing list to put the focus on ServiceMix 4.x entirely and starting to
communicate to our user base that we are no longer planning lots of new activity on the ServiceMix 3.x branches.  We
came up with a plan to do 2 more 3.4.x fix releases until the end of 2012, but no new minor releases are being planned
at the moment.
