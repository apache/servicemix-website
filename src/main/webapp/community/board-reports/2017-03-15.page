Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Issues
======

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Activity
========

The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF, Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ.

During the last period we have released the final release 7.0.0 of ServiceMix 7,
which is based on Karaf 4.0.x and includes numerous new features. In the new
period we are going to focus on the further development, stability and maintenance
of ServiceMix 7.

We have also released the version 5.6.3, which was the last scheduled version of
ServiceMix 5, which has been transited to EOL.

We're not expecting too much dependency updates to become available for the 6.1.x,
which is currently the only active branch of ServiceMix 6, but we do plan to keep
our release schedule going with the 6.1.x releases.

During the past period we have also released 4 sets of OSGi bundles and a new release
of Depends Maven Plugin.

We plan to keep a steady release schedule and keep up with new fix releases of our
dependency projects.

Our goal for the next months is also to improve the documentation and examples, which
is our still outstanding theme.
