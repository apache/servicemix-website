{code}
Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Issues
======

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Activity
========

The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF, Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ.

During the las period we have provided the users with new maintenance releases
(5.5.4, 6.0.3) and new updates 5.6.1 and 6.1.1 from the development branches.
We have also released new OSGi bundle sets and ServiceMix Specs.

We can observe decreasing activity on dependency version used by the 5.5.x and
5.6.x versions, so we expect decreasing activity on ServiceMix 5 next months and
transiting it in 'end of life' state soon.

We plan to focus on ServiceMix 6 and ServiceMix 7 instead, to provide users with
latest and greatest technology and upgrades of Apache Karaf, ActiveMQ, Camel and
CXF versions. We plan to release new versions of ServiceMix 6 next weeks.

We are working on the new ServiceMix 7.0.0.M2 which should be released next days.
During the next period we plan to release the final version of ServiceMix 7 and
return to the work on migration of the documentation.
