Description
===========

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Issues
======

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Activity
========

The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF, Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ.

- We have released 3 sets of OSGi bundles and some Specs bundles.
- We plan to migrate our repositories to gitbox during the next weeks.
- We should focus more intensively on ServiceMix assembly based on the
newest Apache Camel and Apache Karaf, what was a bit outstanding last months.
- We should focus on documentation and samples improvement.
