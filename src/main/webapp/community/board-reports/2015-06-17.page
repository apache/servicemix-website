Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Project Status
--------------
The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF, Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ.

Activity on the mailing lists and in JIRA is picking up. We had some new 
controbutions and one new contributor filed iCLAs specifically for contributing 
to Apache ServiceMix. We also have been giving a talk about ServiceMix during 
an Open Source Day conference in Warsaw.

We have released the second preview of ServiceMix 6.0.0, which is based on 
Karaf 3.0.x and includes numerous new features. We have also released the next 
stable release 5.4.1, the next maintenance release 5.1.5 and the transition releases
between 5.1.x and 5.4.x line. We have also provided 2 sets of OSGi bundles and 1 set 
of OSGi-fied specs.

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Currently 49 committers and 22 PMC members in the project. No new PMC members nor 
committers were added in the last 3 months. Last committer addition was Wim Verreydt

Community Objectives
--------------------
We plan to release the final version of ServiceMix 6 for the beginning of June.
After the 6.0.0 release, the goal will be to make the branch 6.0.x as a new stable line 
of ServiceMix. 

For the beginning of June we also plan the next stable release 5.4.2 containing minor depenecy 
upgrades and bug fixes, and the next release 5.5.0 based on Karaf 2.4.x containing upgrades 
to the newest dependencies and some new features. We plan to keep a steady release schedule and 
keep up with new fix releases of our dependency projects.  

Our goal for the next months is to improve the documentation and website.
