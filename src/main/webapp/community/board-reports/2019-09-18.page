Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

## Project Activity:

- During the last period we have released 3 sets of OSGi bundles:
  - Apache ServiceMix Bundles 2019.06 on June 28 2019
  - Apache ServiceMix Bundles 2019.07 on August 04 2019
  - Apache ServiceMix Bundles 2019.08 on September 05 2019
- We should focus more intensively on ServiceMix assembly based on the
  newestApache Camel and Apache Karaf, what was a bit outstanding last
  months.
- We should focus on documentation and samples improvement.

## Community Health:

Due to summer vacation the activity of the community (mailing lists, JIRA,
releases) has been a bit slower than during the last period.
