h2. A new committer and a new PMC member

The ServiceMix community has been active doing new releases the past few months.
This is only possible by the support we get from our entire community.

Whenever a contributor stands out because of the quality of his patches and the
amount of time and energy spent on the project, we are happy to invite him to
become a committer on the project.  Please welcome Wim Verreydt as our newest
committer!

It is also very encouraging to see a new committer grow to be even more involved
and active in the project after becoming a committer. In recognition of his
continued contribution and commitment to the project, the Apache ServiceMix PMC
has invited Krzysztof Sobkowiak to join the PMC.

On behalf of the ServiceMix PMC: Welcome aboard, guys!
