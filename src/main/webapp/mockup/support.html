      <p>If you are experiencing problems using ServiceMix please report your problem via the <a
              href="http://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/SM">Issue Tracker</a>. You may also find it useful to
          discuss your issues with the community on the <a href="discussion-forums.html">Discussion Forums</a> or join
          one of the <a href="mailing-lists.html">Mailing Lists</a>. Below are some resources to check before asking for
          help: </p>
      <ul>

      <p>Before asking for help with your issue, it's a very good idea to search for your issue in the mailing list
          archives (via the <a href="discussion-forums.html">Discussion Forums</a>) and the FAQ. The majority of issues
          can be solved in this manner without having to send an email to the mailing list. If you don't find an answer,
          use the guidelines below when writing the e-mail.</p>

      <h3 id="HowtoGetHelp">How to Get Help</h3>

      <p>Whenever you are reporting a problem, please be sure to include as much information as possible; the more we
          know, the better the chance of a quicker resolution.</p>
      <ul>
          <li>which version of the software</li>
          <li>what platform and JDK</li>
          <li>any particular container being used - if so what version</li>
          <li>stack traces generally really help! If in doubt include the whole thing; often exceptions get wrapped in
              other exceptions and the exception right near the bottom explains the actual error, not the first few
              lines at the top. Its very easy for us to skim-read past unnecessary parts of a stack trace.
          </li>
          <li>log output can be useful too; sometimes <a href="How do I change the logging.html">enabling DEBUG
              logging</a> can help
          </li>
          <li>your code &amp; configuration files are often useful</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="Howtogethelpfaster">How to get help faster</h3>

      <p>We can help you much quicker if you try the following</p>
      <ul>
          <li>provide us with a JUnit test case that demonstrates your issue. e.g. if you think you've found a bug, can
              you create a test case to demonstrate the bug?
          </li>
          <li><a href="contributing.html">submit a patch</a> fixing the bug! (We also buy you beer when we meet you if
              you submit bug fixes :)
          </li>
          <li>for memory leaks or performance related issues, if you can run a profiler on your test case and attach the
              output as a file (or zipped file if its huge) to the JIRA we can normally fix things much faster. e.g. run
              JProfiler or YourKit on your code and send us the output. To find memory leaks its quicker to resolve if
              you can tell us what classes are taking up all of the RAM; we can normally figure out whats wrong from
              that.
          </li>
      </ul>
